\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Summing up, in this laboratory assignment (T2) we have made both theoretical analysis as well as simulations of several different but similar and correlated circuits. \par
The results obtained in both analysis were either put in a table or plotted in order to make comparations between the theoretical and simulation analysis.
The reasoning behind these results is that we studied a very simple circuit containing only linear components. If the components used were more complex, the case would not be the same and we could detect real differences between the values calculated and simulated. \par
That being said we would like to end this report by presenting both the theoretical and simulation results side by side in order to easily compare the results.
