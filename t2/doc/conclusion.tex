\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Summing up, we have started this laboratory (T1) analyzing the circuit given using two theoretical methods: Mesh analysis and nodal analysis. As we predicted, the results are coincident in module. Then, with NGspice we were able to simulate the circuit and the obtained results were also pretty much coincident with the previous ones. \par
The reasoning behind these results is that we studied a very simple circuit containing only linear components. If the components used were more complex, the case would not be the same and we could detect real differences between the values calculated and simulated.
