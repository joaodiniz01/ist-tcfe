\section{Theoretical Analysis}
\label{sec:analysis}

In this section are shown the obtained results using a suitable theoretical model able to predict the output of the Envelope Detector and voltage Regulator circuits.

\subsection{Envelope detector and voltage regulator plot}
In this plot we can see the output voltage of the envelope and voltage regulator circuits. The envelope detector restricts the voltage's amplitude and the voltage regulator decreases the ripple. \par
